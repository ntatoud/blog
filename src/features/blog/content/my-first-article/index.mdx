This theme comes with the [@astrojs/mdx](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) integration installed and configured in your `astro.config.mjs` config file. If you prefer not to use MDX, you can disable support by removing the integration from your config file.

## Why MDX?

MDX is a special flavor of Markdown that supports embedded JavaScript & JSX syntax. This unlocks the ability to [mix JavaScript and UI Components into your Markdown content](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#mdx-features) for things like interactive charts or alerts.

If you have existing content authored in MDX, this integration will hopefully make migrating to Astro a breeze.

## Example

Here is how you import and use a UI component inside of MDX.  
When you open this page in the browser, you should see the clickable button below.

```tsx title="MyComponent.tsx" showLineNumbers {1, 11}
import React from 'react';

import { Button } from './Button';
import { Card } from './Card';

export default function MyReactComponent() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

```tsx caption="An example with caption" /Click me/
import React from 'react';

import { Button } from './Button';
import { Card } from './Card';

export default function MyReactComponent() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

<Button>Button</Button>
